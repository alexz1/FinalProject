<h6>Project Description</h6>
<p>This project is a interactive story map of the top five producing hydroelectric
dams in the US. Many people ot understand where there electricity supplies comes
from or only knows that it is produced and sold by the city in their specific
regions. I wanted to create a interactive map to let people know that there
are clean energy sources and these dams can produce massive amounts of the
cleanest energy. I am sure after this introduction everyone now has a good idea
of what they are but there are always pros and cons of creating these energy
sources. While I strongly feel that using fossil fuels is not the way towards
the future no matter how clean they become wind and solar will not be able to
produce the amount of energy needed for human consumption. This poses many
challenges in the future and maybe creating hydroelectricity is the way to go
added that there are stricter regulations when it comes to protecting Endangered
species.

<h6>Project goal</h6>
The goal of this project is to inform the users about the pros and cons for
hydroelectricity. Also to show that hydroelectricity is used more often than we
know and can be a very sustainable and cheap source of renewable energy.
